OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure
web application! It can be used in security trainings, awareness demos,
CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses
vulnerabilities from the entire
[OWASP Top Ten](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten) along
with many other security flaws found in real-world applications!

2. Click the button below and follow the instructions

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

> This is the quickest way to get a running instance of Juice Shop! If
> you have forked this repository, the deploy button will automatically
> pick up your fork for deployment! As long as you do not perform any
> DDoS attacks you are free to use any tools or scripts to hack your
> Juice Shop instance on Heroku!

OWASP Juice Shop officially supports the following versions of
[node.js](http://nodejs.org) in line as close as possible with the
official [node.js LTS schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS). Docker
images and packaged distributions are offered accordingly.

## Demo

Feel free to have a look at the latest version of OWASP Juice Shop:
<http://demo.owasp-juice.shop>

> This is a deployment-test and sneak-peek instance only! You are __not
> supposed__ to use this instance for your own hacking endeavours! No
> guaranteed uptime! Guaranteed stern looks if you break it!

## Customization

Via a YAML configuration file in `/config`, the OWASP Juice Shop can be
customized in its content and look & feel.

For detailed instructions and examples please refer to
[our _Customization_ documentation](https://bkimminich.gitbooks.io/pwning-owasp-juice-shop/content/part1/customization.html).

## CTF-Extension

If you want to run OWASP Juice Shop as a Capture-The-Flag event, we
recommend you set it up along with a [CTFd](https://ctfd.io) or
[FBCTF](https://github.com/facebook/fbctf) server conveniently using the
official
[`juice-shop-ctf-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/juice-shop-ctf-cli)
tool.

For step-by-step instructions and examples please refer to
[the _Hosting a CTF event_ chapter](https://bkimminich.gitbooks.io/pwning-owasp-juice-shop/content/part1/ctf.html)
of our companion guide ebook.
